HTML elements are used to **describe** the structure of the page as example <header>,<footer>,<main>, <article> etc...
They also provide **semantic** information as example <em>, <strong>, <sub> etc...

CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like). Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements. Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface. CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.
