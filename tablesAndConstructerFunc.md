# Html Tabls and Js constructor function

The `<table>` element is used to add tables to a web page. A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created
with the `<tr>` element. Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the `<td>` element (or `<th>` if it is a header). You can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes. For long tables you can split the table into a `<thead>`,
`<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`.

The constructor method is a special method of a class for creating and initializing an object of that class.

`function Person(first, last, age, eye) { this.firstName = first; this.lastName = last; this.age = age; this.eyeColor = eye;}`

`var myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");`
