# Psychological Safety Talk

**Seven ways to create psychological safety:**

1. Break the “Golden Rule”

   - Treat others as they’d like to be treated.

2. Welcome curiosity

   - it makes us more present to the journey, more creative, better at communicating alignment with each other, and more agile and adaptive what’s happening when we arrive at an obstacle on the road.

3. Promote healthy conflict

   - strive to create conditions for the healthiest form of conflict.

4. Give employees a voice

   - create liberal pathways to leadership, provide channels for feedback, and encourage conversation.

5. Earn and extend trust

   - key requirement for the perfect team. But it’s not enough to acknowledge that trust is critical—you need to build it, keep it, and be an example for others.

6. Promote effectiveness not efficiency

   - the important role that leaders play in creating a safe and secure working environment. Leaders shouldn’t view people as a means to an end to achieve financial outcomes or other measures of efficiency.

7. Think differently about creativity

   - use an unconventional approach to creativity to solidify psychological safety in their organization. Counter to instinct, they’ve built a culture around taking risks, where all ideas are encouraged and unpredictable paths are embraced.
