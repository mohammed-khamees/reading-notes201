# Images in Html and Colors and Text in CSS

The `<img>` element is used to add images to a web page. You must always specify a `src` _attribute_ to indicate the
source of an image and an `alt` _attribute_ to describe the content of an image.
You should save images at the **size** you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
_Photographs_ are best saved as **JPEGs**; _illustrations_ or _logos_ that use flat colors are better saved as **GIFs**.

Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:

- RGB values
- hex codes
- color names

Color pickers can help you find the color you want. It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
_CSS3_ has introduced an extra value for **RGB** colors to indicate opacity. It is known as **RGBA**.
_CSS3_ also allows you to specify colors as **HSL** values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as **HSLA**.

There are properties to control the choice of:

- font
- size
- weight
- style
- spacing

There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.
If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.
You can control the space between _lines of text_, _individual letters_, and _words_. Text can also be _aligned_
to the **left**, **right**, **center**, or **justified**. It can also be indented.
You can use **pseudo-classes** to change the style of an element when a user **hovers** over or _clicks_ on _text_, or
when they have _visited a link_.
