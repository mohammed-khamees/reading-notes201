## JavaScript Basics

A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe. Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value. Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script. Arrays are special types of variables that store more
than one piece of related information. JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
Expressions evaluate into a single value. Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next. Comparison operators
(===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands. Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
set of comparison operators.

if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code

if a condition is true, and another if it is false.

switch statements allow you to compare a value

against possible outcomes (and also provides a default

option if none match).

Data types can be coerced from one type to another. All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy. There are three types of loop: for, while,and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
