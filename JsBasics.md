# JavaScript Basics

A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe. Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value. Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script. Arrays are special types of variables that store more
than one piece of related information. JavaScript distinguishes between

- **_numbers (0-9)_**
- **_strings (text)_**
- **_Boolean values (true or false)_**
- **_Expressions evaluate into a single value. Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value._**

**Conditional** statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next. Comparison operators
`(===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)` are used to compare two operands. _Logical operators_ allow you to combine more than one
set of _comparison operators_.

`if ... else` statements allow you to run one set of code

if a condition is `true`, and another if it is `false`.

`switch` statements allow you to compare a value

against possible outcomes (and also provides a default

option if none match).

_Data types_ can be coerced from one type to another. All values evaluate to either **truthy** or **falsy**. There are three types of loop: `for`,`while`,and `do ... while`. Each **repeats** a set of statements.
