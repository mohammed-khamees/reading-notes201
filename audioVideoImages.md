# HTML Audio, Video, Images

The `<img>` element is used to add images to a web page. You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the
source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image. You should save images at the size you will be using
them on the web page and in the appropriate format. _Photographs_ are best saved as **JPEGs**; _illustrations_ or
_logos_ that use flat colors are better saved as **GIFs**.

Search engine optimization helps visitors find your sites when using search engines. Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to
see how many people visit your site, how they find it, and what they do when they get there.
To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting.
FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.
Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website
tools (to save you writing them from scratch).

Flash allows you to add animations, video and audio to the web.
Flash is not supported on iPhone or iPad. **HTML5** introduces new `<video>` and `<audio>`
elements for adding video and audio to web pages, but these are only supported in the latest browsers.
Browsers that support the HTML5 elements do not all support the same video and audio formats, so you
need to supply your files in different formats to ensure that everyone can see/hear them.
